Installing and running
----------------------------------------------
Before running the program with shell file, it is fundamental to install two libraries:
lncurses and libbitmap.

For installing lncurses, you can run on the terminal the following command:

``` sudo apt-get install libncurses-dev```

For installing libbitmap, you can download the repository from github, by doing:

``` git clone https://github.com/draekko/libbitmap```

Navigate to the root directory of the downloaded repo and run the configuration through command ``` ./configure```. Configuration might take a while. While running, it prints some messages telling which features it is checking for.

Type ``` make``` to compile the package.

Run ``` sudo make install``` to install the programs and any data files and documentation.
Upon completing the installation, check if the files have been properly installed by navigating to /usr/local/lib, where you should find the libbmp.so shared library ready for use.
In order to properly compile programs which use the libbitmap library, you first need to notify the linker about the location of the shared library. To do that, you can simply add the following line at the end of your .bashrc file:

``` export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/usr/local/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH"```

After doing that, it is the time to create the binary of all 3 processes and run the programm. Before running it, you need to make second.sh executable, by using on the terminal:

``` chmod u+x second.sh```

You can find second.sh into ```add_materials``` folder, but, when launched, this file must be in the same folder of the project. 
Then launch it to create all binary and execute the program, by the command:

```./second.sh```

Once you have done this, the program is successfully launched!

Description of the program
----------------------------------------------

This program simulates a typical vision system, able to track an object in a 2-D plane.
After starting, the program spawns two different konsole windows: one for the camera where a RGB image of the object will be displayed (process A) and one for simulating the extraction of a feature from the image (process B).
More precisely, in the process A window it is possible to do two things:
* moving the image, using the arrow keys on your keyboard;
* pressing the 'P' button, which will make the program take a snaphot of the image and save it on a .bpm file, inside the 'out' folder; if you press several times the P button, you will see many captures in the out folder, named as **snapN.bmp**, where N stands for the number of screenshot.

The movement of the image is not completely free: in fact, there are horizonthal and vertical bounds, which will stop the image from going further (IMPORTANT NOTE: the walls are NOT visible, the image will just stop and won't go any further in that direction).

On the process B window, the center of the image will be shown, which is the extracted feature.
If we move the image on the process A, the center of the image on process B will also move, and leave the image trajectory behind itself.

The program can be terminated if and only if you press ctrl+c on the two **konsole** windows; if you press involuntary ctrl+c on the **terminal** window, do not be worry: the program will not end unless you press, as it has written before, ctrl+c on the two **konsole** windows.

Development of the program
----------------------------------------------

The program consists in three processes:

* **Master process** This is the process which creates, truncates the segment of shared memory and starts everything: after starting its execution, this process spawns two other processes, passing them, as argument, the name of shared memory. When all two children ends their execution ( user presses ctrl+c), it closes the file descriptor, unmap its memory address and then unlink the shared segment memory.

* **Process A** This process shows a grapich interface, where there are a sort of green "cross" and a P button. If the P button is pressed, a screenshot of the image is captured and saved. Process A has the task to register as bmp file, in the shared memory, the current position of the circle in the 80x30 px area. Firstly it creates the image of the circle, with a readius of 30 px and spawns it in the middle of the area, then, every time the user presses any arrow buttons on the keyboard, it creates a new image of the current position of the figure, which replaces the old one. The resolution of image is 1600x600 px, so there is a factor of 20x in the building of it. Actually the process does not share the bmp file in the shared memory, because it is a dynamic structure; there is one more step for doing that: it copies, bit for bit, the whole structure into an array of char and, obviously, shares it. The vector is built in the same way: if it finds colored pixel, sets '1', otherwise '0'. When the user presses ctrl+C on keyboard, this process closes all file descriptor, unlinks semaphores and terminates its own execution.

* **Process B** This process shows a grapich interface, where at the beggining there is a 0 in the middle. It continuosly reads the data from shared memory, converts them into a bitmap file, which size is now 80x30 px, so it resizes the image dividing by a factor of 20x; then it has to find the current center of the circle, and, finally, draws the trajectory of it. For finding the center of the circle, process B scans the whole vector associates to the bitmap structure, which has 960000 elements, and, after finding 59 adjacent colored pixel ( setted as character '1' in the vector), it register the coordinates of the center; if the 59 consecutive pixels are not found, it means that we are close to the upper/lower border and in this case we check where the maximum number of consecutive blue pixels was located, then we have found the center. Trajectory consists in a sort of vertical and horizontal hyphens, and 0 represents where is the current center. Actually the position of the center  in an almost real time, because there is some delay in reading the shared memory and in rebuilding the image. When the user presses ctrl+C on keyboard, this process closes all file descriptor, unlinks semaphores and terminates its own execution.
NOTE: DO NOT RESIZE THIS WINDOW, BECAUSE IT WILL ISTANTENOUSLY CRASH THE PROCESS!
